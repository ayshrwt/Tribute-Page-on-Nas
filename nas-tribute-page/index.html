      <h3 class="text-center">  NAS' EARLY LIFE</h3>
        <p >As a kid, Nas wanted to be an instrumentalist. His father is jazz/blues musician Olu Dara, and Nas sometimes practiced with his dad's trumpet.<br>Nas was also into comics. But, he immersed himself into the hip-hop culture shortly after his parents Olu Dara and Ann Jones separated. That was when young Nasir Jones began to write short stories and poetry.</p><br>
   <h3 class="text-center"> THE MAKING OF ILLMATIC: THE HIP-HOP BIBLE</h3>
      <p>Nas made his hip-hop debut on "Halftime," which was featured on MC Serch's soundtrack to Zebrahead. In mid 1992, MC Serch helped Nas secure a deal with Columbia Records. The initial concern was that Columbia, a major label, would dilute Nas' raw rap style. In 1994, Illmatic was released and its grimy feel allayed all fears. The album featured production by DJ Premier, Large Professor, Pete Rock, and Q-Tip, and a relatively unknown emcee named AZ. It was lauded as a masterpiece.</p>
